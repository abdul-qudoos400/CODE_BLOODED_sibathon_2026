Personal Finance Copilot — What It Means

Personal Finance Copilot is an intelligent money assistant that helps users track expenses, set budgets, and get personalized insights — all in plain language. Instead of manually logging numbers, users can ask questions like a chat, see spending patterns, and get proactive suggestions to save and plan for their goals.

Just like a copilot helps a pilot, this app helps users navigate their financial life by:
Tracking spending
Suggesting smart decisions
Forecasting budget trends
Answering finance questions
